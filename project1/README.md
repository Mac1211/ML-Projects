# Overview:

The dataset used in this project is Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv. It represents transaction data where each row corresponds to a transaction, and each column corresponds to an item. The dependencies are numpy, Matplolib, pandas and apyori.

# Contents:

1. apriori_algorithm.py: Python script for implementing the Apriori algorithm for market basket analysis.
2. eclat.py: Python script for implementing the eclat algorithm for market basket analysis.
3. Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv: Dataset containing transaction data for market basket analysis.
4. README.md: This file providing an overview of the project.

# Result:
The script provides results in the form of associations between items based on the Apriori and eclat algorithms. It displays associations both directly from the output of the Apriori function,eclat function and organizes them in a well-organized Pandas DataFrame. The results can help in understanding which items are frequently purchased together and can inform strategies for product placement, promotions, and marketing campaigns.
