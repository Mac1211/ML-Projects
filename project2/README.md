# Overview:

This repository contains Python code for performing K-Means and Hierarchical clustering on customer data to segment them based on their annual income and spending score. K-Means and Hierarchical clustering are unsupervised machine learning algorithms used to partition data into clusters based on similarity. The dataset used in this project is Mall_Customers.csv. It contains information about customers including their annual income and spending score. The dependencies are numpy, Matplolib, pandas and scikit-learn.
# Contents:

1. Kmeans_clustering.py: Python script for performing K-Means clustering on the customer dataset.
2. hierarchical_clustering.py: Python script for performing hierarchical clustering on the customer dataset.
3. Mall_Customers.csv: Dataset containing customer information.
4. README.md: This file providing an overview of the project.

# Result:

The script generates a visualization showing the clusters of customers based on their annual income and spending score. It helps in understanding customer segmentation which can be valuable for marketing and business strategies.
